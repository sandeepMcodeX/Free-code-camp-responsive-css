        <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About
          this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
          aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from
          2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
          studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
          decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
          Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
          Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
          India's civilian space programme and military missile development
          efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
          his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
